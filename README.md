## Back-End Development


<p align="center"> <a href="postman.md"> " postman " </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

We use postman for our app back-End . It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated.


<p align="center"> <a href="mongodb.md"> " mongodb " </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

We use mongodb for our app back-End . MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.


<p align="center"> <a href="vscode.md"> " Visual Studio Code " </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

We use Visual Studio Code for our app back-End . Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
