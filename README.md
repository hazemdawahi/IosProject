## Front-End Development

** Technology : " SWIFT "
- [SWIFT.js]

We use technology swift for our app . Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.

** Architecture : " MVVM "

We use architecture MVVM for our app . In most of our application, we have a view controller (UI) which needs to fetch data from the server(API) and need to display it in the UI. We will implement the same behavior using the MVVM Pattern.
